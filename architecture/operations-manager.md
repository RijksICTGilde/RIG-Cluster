# Operations Manager Architecture

## Overview

The Operations Manager (OPI) consists of a **frontend** web interface and a **backend** FastAPI service deployed in each cluster. The backend processes project files to create complete "deployments" - combinations of Kubernetes manifests and required services like databases, storage, and authentication.

        ProjectFiles[Project Files<br/>YAML Configurations]
    end
    
    subgraph "Cluster A"
        BackendA[Backend<br/>Reads project files]
        ManifestsA[Generated Manifests<br/>& Services]
    end
    
    subgraph "Cluster B"
        BackendB[Backend<br/>Reads project files]
        ManifestsB[Generated Manifests<br/>& Services]
    end

## Backend Processing Detail

    end
    
    subgraph BackendProc ["Backend Processing"]
        Backend[Backend Processor<br/>Reads & Processes]
    end
    
    subgraph ServiceProv ["Service Provisioning"]
        DB[Database<br/>Schema & Connections]
        Auth[Keycloak<br/>Realm & Client Setup]
        Storage[MinIO<br/>Bucket & Access Setup]
        More[...]
    end
    
    subgraph ServiceInfo ["Service Information"]
        Credentials[Connection Info<br/>URLs, Credentials, Configs]
    end
    
    subgraph GeneratedMan ["Generated Manifests"]
        Deployment[Deployment<br/>+ Service Connection Info]
        Service[Service<br/>Network Configuration]
        Ingress[Ingress<br/>External Access]
    end

## Key Concepts

**Frontend**: Web interface where project teams configure their deployments through forms

**Backend**: FastAPI application deployed in each cluster that wants to be managed

**Project File**: YAML configuration defining what the project needs (app specs, database, storage, etc.)

**Deployment**: Complete environment created from a project file, including:
- Kubernetes manifests (deployments, services, ingress)
- Required services (PostgreSQL database, MinIO storage, Keycloak authentication)
- Networking and security policies

**Processing Flow**: 
1. Project File â†’ Backend Processing 
2. Backend sets up required services (DB, Auth, Storage)
3. Service connection information is automatically injected into Kubernetes manifests
4. Generated manifests deployed to cluster with all necessary service connectivity
