"""Generic approval capability for the service catalog (RC-5).

A service declares -- as data -- that some value it manages needs approval before it
takes effect ("dit heeft approval nodig"), and supplies the rule that reads the stored
approval state back ("is dit veld approved?"). Generic code (a future catalog-driven
approval interface, and the enforcers today) consumes these ``ApprovalSpec``s uniformly
instead of hard-coding one subsystem per approvable thing.

Grounded in the single real case today: publish-on-web's domain / subdomain approval,
whose state lives in the project's ``domains:`` block and whose rules are the pure
predicates in ``connectors/subdomain.py``. This module does NOT move that state or
rewrite those rules -- it wraps them so the shape (declare + check) is visible and
reusable. Moving the state under the service is a separate schema+data migration
(see features/futures/service-vertical-slice.md).

    """A service's declaration that a value it manages requires approval.

    This is the DEFINITION ("dit heeft approval nodig"): a service returns one or more
    of these from ``config_approvals(layer)``. It is pure data plus rule callbacks --
    it carries no forms / manager / DB imports, so the catalog stays load-light.

    Attributes:
        key: Stable identifier for this approvable within the service (e.g. ``"domain"``,
            ``"subdomain"``). Used to look the spec up and to key any UI / state.
        label: Human label for the approver-facing interface.
        approver: Who may approve (see :class:`ApproverScope`).
        status_of: The CHECK ("is dit veld approved?"). Given the project data and the
            value being requested, returns its :class:`ApprovalStatus` by reading the
            stored approval state. The service owns this rule; generic code just calls
            it. The ``value`` is opaque to the generic layer -- its shape is the
            service's business (a domain string, a ``(domain, subdomain)`` pair, ...).
        list_items: The LIST ("wat staat er open voor deze aanvraag?"). Enumerates the
            approvable items this spec currently has in a project, as
            :data:`ApprovalItem` dicts. The generic approver interface concatenates
            these across the catalog instead of hard-coding one subsystem's shape.
            ``None`` for a check-only spec that does not surface in the approver UI.
        record: The RECORD ("leg het oordeel vast"). Applies one approver verdict --
            writes the new status + appends ``history_entry`` to the stored state for
            the given item. ``None`` if the spec is not approver-writable.
